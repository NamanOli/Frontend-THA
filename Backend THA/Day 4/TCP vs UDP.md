## TCP vs UDP
----------------
They are layer 4(transport) protocols.

### TCP
Pros  
1. Acknowledgement.
2. Guaranteed delivery.
3. Connection based (stateful connection is maintained on both ends.)
4. Congestion Control
5. Ordered packets

Cons  
1. Larger packets
2. More bandwidth
3. Slower than UDP
4. Stateful 
5. Server memory(DOS)
 
### UDP
Pros  
1. Smaller packets
2. Less bandwidth
3. Stateless
4. Faster than tcp


### Cons
Cons
1. NO Acknowledgement
2. No Guaranteed delivery
3. Connectionless
4. No Congestion control
5. No Ordered packets
6. Security
